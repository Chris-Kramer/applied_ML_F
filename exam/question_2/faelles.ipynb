    "### Architectures\n",
    "Before we begin building complex architectures for the CNN model, we must establish a baseline classifier which we will attempt to beat. This common-sense baseline will tell us if we are moving in the right direction. In our case, we can choose a simple random classifier with a threshold of 0.5 since we have a binary classification problem where half of the samples belong to class A and the remaining 50% belong to class B. We could also specify a 'simple' machine learning algorithm as a baseline, but although we do not do this explicitly, we will aim to beat the trained models in question 1 as CNNs has some properties that make them superior to non-deep learning algorithms and feedforward neural networks (Chollet, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the first thing we want to achieve is statistical power, i.e. to cross the threshold of our baseline classifier by developing a small model. To do so, we focus on parameters such as the loss function, batch_size, learning rate, etc. Due to the way we represent the labels, we will use the softmax activation and the loss function categorical cross entropy rather than sigmoid and binary cross entropy, however, this will not change the results of our models."
